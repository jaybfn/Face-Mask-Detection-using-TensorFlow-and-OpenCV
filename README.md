### Construct a CNN2D model to detect if a person is wearing a face mask or not with your webcam

In most public meetings, such as malls, theaters, and parks, it is becoming increasingly vital to verify if persons in the audience are wearing face masks. The creation of an AI system that can detect if someone is wearing a face mask and allow them admission would be extremely beneficial to society. A basic Face Mask identification system is constructed using Convolutional Neural Networks, a Deep Learning approach (CNN). The TensorFlow framework and the OpenCV library were used to create this CNN Model, which is widely utilized in real-time applications.
